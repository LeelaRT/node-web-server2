    <h2>What is Node.js?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Node.js is an open source server environment</li>
        <li>Node.js is free</li>
        <li>Node.js runs on various platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.)</li>
        <li>Node.js uses JavaScript on the server</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

    <h2>Why Node.js?</h2><li>Sends the task to the computer's file system.</li>

      A common task for a web server can be to open a file on the server and return the content to the client.<br/><br/>
      Here is how PHP or ASP handles a file request:
    <ol>
      <li>Sends the task to the computer's file system.</li>
      <li>Waits while the file system opens and reads the file.</li>
      <li>Returns the content to the client.</li>
      <li>Ready to handle the next request.</li>
    </ol>
    Here is how Node.js handles a file request:
    <ol>
      <li>Sends the task to the computer's file system.</li>
      <li>Ready to handle the next request.</li>
      <li>When the file system has opened and read the file, the server returns the content to the client.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    Node.js eliminates the waiting, and simply continues with the next request.<br/>
Node.js runs single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronously programming, which is very memory efficient.
